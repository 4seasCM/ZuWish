# 为什么是许愿池？｜Why We Need the Wishing Pool?

在现实世界中，许愿池是一个让人们思考并表达自己内心对未来期许的地方，它跨越文化和地域的差异，广泛的存在于每一个对社会现实有所希冀的角落。人们通过仪式性的动作，将自己的愿望寄托于神明或者宇宙；又或是借助许愿池这个特殊的公共空间，与身边的人分享自己的愿望，通过真诚且具有想象力的公开个体表达，创造一种超越个体间的联结，并彼此祝福。

In real life, a Wishing Pool is a place where people reflect on and express their inner hopes for the future. It transcends cultural and geographical barriers and exists widely in every corner of society where people have hopes for better social realities. Through ritualistic gestures, people entrust their wishes to gods or the universe. Alternatively, by sharing their wishes with those around them through sincere and imaginative public expressions in this symbolic public space, people create connections between individuals, and give blessings to each other.

每一个愿望，无论是私人亦或公共的，都是一种个体对内心所期待现实的呼唤。而许愿池，则是这些多样的社会召唤所汇集之处。基于物理空间的许愿池，只能有限的传递这些愿望，让愿望真实发生的过程，更多还是依赖个体的努力，或者寄希望于神明的青睐。

Every wish, whether private or public, is a call from the individual to the desired reality in their heart. The Wishing Pool is where these diverse social calls converge. Based on physical space, the Wishing Pool can only convey these wishes to a limited extent. The process of making wishes come true depends more on the individual's efforts, or the favor of the gods.

在信息技术变革的今天，如果我们能够通过互联网广泛的链接彼此的愿望，让这些对社会充满想象力的心愿互相被看见，或许我们就能够联结更多具有相似期待的人，让一些具备共识的愿望得以发生。

In today's era of information technology, if we could link each other's wishes through the internet, and let these imaginative wishes for society be seen by each other, perhaps we could connect more people with similar expectations, and make some consensus wishes come true.

基于链上设施构建一个能被所有人共享的许愿池，是让这个时代的社会召唤被看见，并让它们真正成为某种现实的触发器。

Building a globally shared Wishing Pool based on blockchain infrastructure is to make the social calls of this era visible to the public and to truly trigger them to become a certain reality.

# 许愿，作为一种社会想象力｜Making Wishes, as a Form of Social Imagination

当我们说「我们要建造一个更美好的世界」时，这个愿望，究竟指向哪些具体的现实？

When we say "we want to build a better world", what specific realities does this wish refer to?

对于一个更美好社会的想象，不同文化背景的个体，会作出截然不同的具象表达。这些多元的表达，并不是凭空出现的，它们来自于对现实处境的深刻体会和理解，从真实生活的体感中提炼出对这个现实的期许。

Individuals from different cultural backgrounds will have radically different concrete expressions when imagining a better society. These diverse expressions are not created out of thin air; rather, they stem from a profound understanding and experience of the current situation, and extract expectations for this reality from the sensory experience of real life.

所以没有一个关于「更美好世界」的统一标准，不从现实出发泛泛而谈的改变世界是空洞的，脱离了真实需求的技术生产是冗余且错位的。

Therefore, there is no unified standard for a "better world". Talking about changing the world without starting from reality is empty, and technical production that is detached from real needs is redundant and misplaced.

社会想象力，不是无边无际的天马行空，而是紧贴现实却又不受制于眼前困境的一种创造性的思考方式。而许愿，则是对这种创造性思考的公开表达。

Social imagination is not boundless and fanciful, but a creative way of thinking that is closely tied to reality yet not limited by immediate obstacles. And making a wish, is an open expression of this creative thinking.

为了实现建设一个更美好世界的愿望，我们需要身处不同现实的个体共同作出有想象力的表达。每一种对社会的美好想象都是独特的，没有哪一个现实的具体愿望可以被他者代为表达。

In order to achieve the wish of building a better world, we need individuals from different backgrounds to voice their own imaginations in response to their environments. Each vision of a better society is unique, and no concrete wish raised from a specific reality can be expressed by others.

一个全球共享的许愿池，便是承载这些人们对美好世界的不同想象，并作出公开表达的公共领域。

The Wishing Pool is a globally shared public domain that bears people's different imaginations of a better world, and serves as a platform for public expressions. 

## 从个体和社区出发｜Starting from Individuals and Communities

我们共处在一个世界秩序陷入更深混乱的时代。国际冲突和战争频繁的发生，全球政治环境不断加剧的动荡，经济的不确定性带来更多国际贸易的摩擦，全球化的链接本是一个让人类携手共进的理想，却在今天的现实中表现的如此破碎不堪。面对这些巨大的冲突，没有任何一种解决方案可以一劳永逸地平息我们的不安。

We live in an era where the world order is plunging into deeper chaos. International conflicts and wars occur frequently, the global political environment is constantly worsening, economic uncertainty brings more friction to international trade. The globalization that was supposed to be a human ideal for collaboration has shown such a fragile and broken reality today. Faced with these great conflicts, no solution can permanently quell our anxiety.

但是，作为一个热爱这个世界的独立个体，即使我们无法凭一己之力撼动那些根深蒂固的恶疾，我们依然保有想象一种美好社会的能力。这种可贵的想象力，能够指引我们找到志同道合的人，并共同去构建一个允许我们惬意生存的小环境。

However, as independent individuals who love this world, even if we cannot shake those deep-rooted diseases on our own, we still have the ability to imagine a better society. This valuable ability to imagine can guide us to find like-minded people and work together to build a small environment that allows us to live comfortably.

**一个更好社会的最小单元，是由个体和其所在社区所构成的。**无论是比特币的出现，或是网络国家叙事的诞生，都源自于某个个体在回应这现实时所发出的一声召唤。这种社会召唤，不断地吸引更多有共识的人加入，慢慢地形成自己的社区，在漫长时间的成长中，终将汇聚成为一股改变世界的力量。

**A better society should be composed of individuals and their communities as the smallest unit.** Whether it is the emergence of Bitcoin or the birth of the Network State narrative, it all originates from a call made by individuals in response to the reality. These social callings continuously attract more like-minded people to join, slowly forming its own communities. Over a long period of growth, they will eventually converge into a force that change the world.

因此，不要无力的屈服于你所不认同的世界。

Therefore, DO NOT succumb to a world that you don't agree with.

不要放弃你与生俱来向往美好生活的天性。

Do not give up your innate desire for a better life.

**感知你最深的渴望，调动你最真诚的想象，公开的向这个世界阐述你所期待的现实，许下你的心愿。**

**Perceive your deepest desires, mobilize your most sincere imagination, and publicly articulate the reality you expect from this world. Make a wish.**

这个愿望可以很宏大，即使你作为一个单独的个体可能无法实现它，但是一个面向全球共享的许愿池系统，会让支持这个愿望的人能够找到彼此，并去共同协商实现愿望的具体方式。

This wish can be very ambitious, even if as an individual you may not be able to achieve it. However, The Wishing Pool shared globally would allow people who support this wish to find each other and work together to negotiate specific ways to achieve it.

这个愿望可以很微小，即使它可能只关乎于改善你所处的社区环境，一个基于链上设施公开透明的许愿池，或许能够帮助你收获附近居民的支持，这个愿望就更有可能被实现。

This wish can be very small, even if it may only be related to improving the community environment you are in. The Wishing Pool based on transparent on-chain infrastructure may help you gain support from nearby residents, making it more likely for your wish to come true.

**许愿池，是让每个人都能发出社会召唤的声音，并收获祝福与回响的广场。**

**The Wishing Pool is a cyber public square for everyone to make wishes and receive their blessings and echos. It is a trigger to the social callings.**

## 地区性公共物品的诞生｜The Rise of Regional Public Goods

当人们因为不同的共识，开始形成多元化的社区时，一些以社区作为主体提出的愿望就会开始出现。

When people start forming diverse communities based on different consensuses, some wishes proposed by the community as a whole will begin to emerge.

一个由社区提出的愿望，意味着它是经历过某种内部协商过程，并达成了一定的共识基础，但是却不一定能在该社区内部通过自身资源的协调分配所实现的一些期待。这类型愿望的公开表达，意味着社区在向外部环境发出请求支援的声音。

A wish proposed by the community has gone through an internal negotiation process and reached a certain consensus foundation. However, it may not necessarily be achievable through the coordination and allocation of community resources alone. Publicly expressing these wishes means that the community is requesting support from the external environment.

然而在现实中，不同的社区之间，往往因价值观的差异而存在着边界，彼此间缺乏良好的沟通和交流渠道，阻碍了跨社区合作的发生。

However, in reality, boundaries often exist between different communities due to differences in values. These boundaries can lead to a lack of communication and exchange channels, which hinders cross-community collaboration.

许愿池作为一个让所有人都能对愿望进行公开表达的地方，能够让社区间跨越彼此价值观差异的部分，聚焦于了解彼此的期望，找到共同点，并以此为基础展开跨社区合作。这种合作，不仅能够促使地方社区对于一些共同的需求进行提炼和协商，形成集体的解决方案；更能够聚集更多人的力量，催生出地区性的公共物品，推动更大范围的社会变革。

The Wishing Pool is a platform for everyone to openly express their wishes. It can bridge value differences between communities by focusing on understanding each other's expectations, finding common ground, and launching cross-community cooperation. This collaboration can refine and negotiate common needs of local communities, form collective solutions, gather more people's support, generate regional public goods, and promote larger-scale social changes.

**许愿池是一个能够为多元社区提供公共领域的平台，促进各种社会想象力的交融，用共同的愿望打破社区间的边界，成为一种促进地区性资源协调分配的社会支持系统。**

**The Wishing Pool serves as platform that provides public space for diverse communities. It promotes the integration of various social imagination, breaks the boundaries between communities with common wishes, and will become a social support system that promotes regional resource coordination and distribution.**

## 全球愿望概览｜The Whole Earth Wish Catalog

斯图尔特·布兰德在1968年用《全球概览》的方式，为互联网尚未普及的世界带来了一种理解全球系统的视角，并通过传递可用工具的信息，激发人们进行自我教育，并创造自己所认可的环境。

In 1968, Stewart Brand brought a global perspective to the world through "The Whole Earth Catalog". At a time when the internet did not yet exist, he inspired self-education and the creation of personally-approved environments by passing on information about available tools.

在互联网技术已经相当普遍的今天，对于工具及信息的获取已不再是人们建构新世界的障碍。然而，人们对于一个更美好世界的期望，却仍然缺乏一种全局性的视角。这种全局视角不意味着某种统一世界的主义，它是因文化的多元而具有极强地区性差异的，是一张动态的期望地图。

Today, with internet technology being widely available, access to tools and information is no longer a barrier for people to build a better world. However, people still lack a global perspective when it comes to their expectations for a better world. This global perspective does not imply a uniform worldview, but rather a dynamic map of expectations with significant regional differences due to cultural diversity.

许愿池作为一个全球共享的许愿平台，可以为人们提供一个展现全球范围内愿望的概览。这个愿望的概览，不仅能够让人们更深入的了解全球各地的社会期待，更能够促进跨地区的协作发生，让多元化的关于更美好社会的愿望，都能够有实现的可能性。

The Wishing Pool is a globally shared platform for making wishes. It provides people with an overview of wishes from around the world, which not only deepens their understanding of social expectations worldwide, but also promotes cross-regional cooperation. This platform enables the realization of diverse wishes to create a better society.

这份愿望的全球概览，也为今天流动在世界范围内，不愿意受国家、种族、地理因素等制约的人们，提供了一张游牧世界的地图——我们可以去往那些，我们所想要实现的愿望正在发生的地方，去共同建设一个拥有更多选择的世界。

This “Whole Earth Wish Catalog” also provides a map of the world for nomads who do not want to be constrained by factors like nationality, race, or geography. We can flow around the world to places where the wishes we want to achieve are happening and build a world with more choices together.

**许愿池，是我们通过许愿的方式，分享彼此对于社会的想象，并共同实践更美好未来的一种起点。**

**The Wishing Pool serves as a starting point for us to share our imagination of society through wishing and to work together towards a better future.**
